## Quick Background on Kali's Live-Build-Config workflow

1. Requires 'debootstrap' and 'live-build' to be installed
2. Removes all 'kali-config' files from the build config
3. Cleans the build config
4. Sets up the initial configuration
5. Executes the build process using its config located in ./auto/config

Note: An important note from this workflow, if you copy a file directly into the build configuration
that has the same filename as a default file in 'kali-config', it will be removed and overwritten
with the kali-config default file as part of this process. Therefore, you MUST place files like these
(e.g. preseed.cfg) into the 'kali-config' directory to avoid it being overwritten at the start of
the build process.
